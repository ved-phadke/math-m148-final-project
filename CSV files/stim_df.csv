in my life who taught me to combine knowledge and wisdom to make an impact was my father a simple cook why is this man ever met in my life just a simple cook left school in the third grade to help out on the Family Farm but just because he left school doesn't mean a education stopped Mark Twain once said I've never allowed my schooling to get in the way of my education my father taught himself how to read taught himself how to write decided in the midst of Jim crowism as America was breeding the last gasp of the Civil War my father decided he was going to stand and be a man not a black man not a brown man not a white man but a man he literally challenged himself to be the best that he could all the days of his life I have four degrees my brother is a judge we're not the smartest ones in our family to third grade Dropout Danny a third grade Dropout daddy who was quoting Michelangelo saying to us boys I won't have a problem if you aim high and Miss but I'm going to have a real issue if you aim low and hit you're right I listens lessons like these son you'd rather be an hour early then a minute late we never knew what time it was in my house because the clocks were always ahead my mother said for nearly 30 years my father left the house at 3 45 in the morning one day she asked him why Daddy he said maybe one of my boys will catch me in the act of Excellence I want to share two things with you Aristotle said you are what you repeatedly do therefore Excellence ought to be a habit not an act don't ever forget that I know you're tough but always remember to be kind always don't ever forget that never embarrass mama mm-hmm yeah yeah Mommy ain't happy ain't nobody happy if Daddy ain't happy don't nobody care but you know I'm trying to tell you next lesson lesson from a cook over there in the galley son make sure your servant's towel is bigger than your ego ego is the anesthesia that deadens the pain of stupidity y'all might have a relative in mind you want to send that to let me say it again ego is the anesthesia that deadens the pain of stupidity pride is the burden of a foolish person John Wooden coached basketball at UCLA for a living but his calling was to impact people and with all those national championships guess what he was found during in the middle of the week going into the cupboard grabbing a broom and sweeping his own gym floor you want to make an impact find your broom every day of your life you find your broom you grow your influence that way that way you're attracting people so that you can impact them final lesson son you're gonna do a job do it right I've always been told how average I can be always been criticized about being average but I want to tell you something I stand here before you before all of these people not listening to those words but telling myself every single day to shoot for the stars to be the best that I can be good enough isn't good enough if it can be better and better isn't good enough if it can be best let me close with a very personal story that I think will bring all this into Focus wisdom will come to you in the unlikeliest of sources a lot of times through failure when you hit rock bottom remember this while you're struggling Rock Bottom can also be a great foundation on which to build and on which to grow I'm not worried that you'll be successful I'm worried that you won't fail from time to time the person that gets up off the canvas and keeps growing that's the person that will continue to grow their influence back in the 70s they helped me make this point let me introduce you to someone I'm at the finest woman I never met in my life back in my day we'd have called her a brick house this woman was the finest woman I'd ever seen in my life there's just one little problem back then ladies didn't like big old linemen The Blind Side hadn't come out yet they like quarterbacks and running backs we're at this dance and I find out her name is Trina Williams from Lompoc California and we were all dancing and we're just just excited and I decide in the middle of dancing with her that I would ask her for her phone number Chic Katrina was the first one Trina was the only woman in college who gave me her real telephone number the next day we walked to Baskin and Robin's ice cream parlor my friends couldn't believe it this has been 40 years ago and my friend still can't believe it we go on a second date and a third day and a fourth day we drive from Chico to Vallejo so that she could meet my parents my father meets her my daddy my hero he meets her pulls me to the side and says is she psycho but anyway we go together for a year two years three years four years by now Trina is a senior in college I'm still a freshman but I'm working some things out foreign I'm so glad I graduated in four terms Nixon Ford Carter Reagan so now it's it's time to propose so I talked to her girlfriends and it's California it's in the 70s so it has to be outside have to have a candle and you have to have you know some chocolate listen I'm from the hood I had a bottle of Boons Farm wine that's what I had she said yes that was the key I married the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen in my y'all ever been to a wedding and even before the wedding starts you hear this how in the world and it was coming from my side of the family we get married we have a few children our lives are great one day Trina finds a lump in her left breasts breast cancer six years after that diagnosis me and my two little boys walked up to Mommy's casket and for two years my heart didn't beat it wasn't for my faith in God I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for those two little boys there would have been no reason for which to go on I was completely lost that was rock bottom you know what sustained me the wisdom of a third grade dropout the wisdom of a simple cook we're at the casket I'd never seen my dad cry but this time I saw my dad cry that was his daughter Trina was his daughter not his daughter-in-law and I'm right behind my father about to see her for the last time on this Earth and my father shared three words with me that changed my life right there at the casket it would be the last lesson he would ever teach me he said Son just stand you keep standing you keep no matter how rough the sea you keep standing and I'm not talking about just water you keep standing no matter what you don't give up and as clearly as I'm talking to you today these were some of her last words to me she looked me in the eye and she said it doesn't matter to me any longer how long I live what matters to me most is How I Live pass y'all one question a question that I was asked All My Life by a third grade dropout how you're living how you're living every day ask yourself that question how you living here's here's what a cook would suggest you to live this way that you would not judge that you would show up early that you'd be kind that you make sure that that servant's town is huge and used that if you're going to do something you do it the right way that that cook would tell you this that it's never wrong to do the right thing that how you do anything is how you do everything and in that way you will grow your influence to make an impact and that way you will honor all those who have gone before you who have invested in you look in those unlikeliest places for

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do ya?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Jason Silva - Existential Bummer (Audio),"Storyteller Jason Silva considers the impermanence of all and the dual nature of human consciousness, through a meditation on a passage from Ernest Becker:  ""Man is literally split in two: he has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumbly to rot and disappear forever"" -Ernest Becker",https://youtu.be/Lz-P3WdIHvw,Lz-P3WdIHvw,foreign [Music] essay written by Sigmund Freud called on transients and in it he cites a conversation that he had with the poet real key as they were walking along this beautiful garden and at one point rilke looked like he was about to tear up and Freud said what's wrong it's a beautiful day there's beautiful plants around us this is magnificent and then realki says well I can't get over the fact that one day all of this is going to die all these trees all these plants all this life is going to Decay everything dissolves in meaninglessness when you think about the fact that impermanence is a really real thing perhaps the greatest existential bummer of all is entropy and I was really struck by this because perhaps that's why when we're in love we're also kind of sad there's a sadness to the Ecstasy you know beautiful thing sometimes can make us a little sad and it's because what they hint at is the exception a vision of something more a vision of a hidden door a Rabbit Hole to fall through but a temporary one and I think ultimately that is kind of the tragedy that is why I love simultaneously fills us with melancholies that's why sometimes I feel nostalgic over something I haven't lost yet because I see it's transients and so how does one respond to this do we do we love harder do we squeeze tighter or do we embrace the Buddhist Creed of no attachment so we pretend not to care than everything and everyone we know is going to be taken away from us and I I don't know if I can accept that I think I'm more sided with the Dylan Thomas quote that says I will not go quietly into that good night but instead rage against the dying of the light I think that we defy entropy and impermanence with our films and our poems I think we hold on to each other a little harder and say I will not let go I do not accept the ephemeral nature of this moment I'm going to extend it forever or at least I'm going to try foreign,FALSE

The Great Dictator,"In the 1940 satire-drama The Great Dictator, Charlie Chaplin plays 2 doppelganger characters: a fascist dictator and a Jewish barber avoiding persecution. In this scene, the Barber is mistaken for the Dictator and must give a speech. Revered as one of the greatest monologues in film history, Chaplin makes a call for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite people in the name of democracy. What you are about to hear is the voice of Charlie Chaplin from the middle of World War II. For his entire career, he had been a silent actor. But in 1940, he decided to speak out. This is his message of hope. ",https://youtu.be/VMgdGswaI5s,VMgdGswaI5s,"I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…

Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!",FALSE
