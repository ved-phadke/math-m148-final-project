on the Family Farm but just because he left school doesn't mean a education stopped Mark Twain once said I've never allowed my schooling to get in the way of my education my father taught himself how to read taught himself how to write decided in the midst of Jim crowism as America was breeding the last gasp of the Civil War my father decided he was going to stand and be a man not a black man not

there in the galley son make sure your servant's towel is bigger than your ego ego is the anesthesia that deadens the pain of stupidity y'all might have a relative in mind you want to send that to let me say it again ego is the anesthesia that deadens the pain of stupidity pride is the burden of a foolish person John Wooden coached basketball at UCLA for a living but his calling was to impact people and with all those national championships guess what he was found during in the middle of the week going into the cupboard grabbing a broom and sweeping his own gym floor you want to make an impact find your broom every day of your life you find your broom you grow your influence that way that way you're attracting people so that you can impact them final lesson son you're gonna do a job do it right I've always been told how average I can be always been criticized about being average but I want to tell you something I stand here before you before all of these people not listening to those words but telling myself every single day to shoot for the stars to be the best that I can be good enough isn't good enough if it can be better and better isn't good enough if it can be best let me close with a very personal story that I think will bring all this into Focus wisdom will come to you in the unlikeliest of sources a lot of times through failure when you hit rock bottom remember this while you're struggling Rock Bottom can also be a great foundation on which to build and on which to grow I'm not worried that you'll be successful I'm worried that you won't fail from time to time the person that gets up off the canvas and keeps growing that's the person that will continue to grow their influence back in the 70s they helped me make this point let me introduce you to someone I'm at the finest woman I never met in my life back in my day we'd have called her a brick house this woman was the finest woman I'd ever seen in my life there's just one little problem back then ladies didn't like big old linemen The Blind Side hadn't come out yet they like quarterbacks and running backs we're at this dance and I find out her name is Trina Williams from Lompoc California and we were all dancing and we're just just excited and I decide in the middle of dancing with her that I would ask her for her phone number Chic Katrina was the first one Trina was the only woman in college who gave me her real telephone number the next day we walked to Baskin and Robin's ice cream parlor my friends couldn't believe it this has been 40 years ago and my friend still can't believe it we go on a second date and a third day and a fourth day we drive from Chico to Vallejo so that she could meet my parents my father meets her my daddy my hero he meets her pulls me to the side and says is she psycho but anyway we go together for a year two years three years four years by now Trina is a senior in college I'm still a freshman but I'm working some things out foreign I'm so glad I graduated in four terms Nixon Ford Carter Reagan so now it's it's time to propose so I talked to her girlfriends and it's California it's in the 70s so it has to be outside have to have a candle and you have to have you know some chocolate listen I'm from the hood I had a bottle of Boons Farm wine that's what I had she said yes that was the key I married the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen in my y'all ever been to a wedding and even before the wedding starts you hear this how in the world and it was coming from my side of the family we get married we have a few children our lives are great one day Trina finds a lump in her left breasts breast cancer six years after that diagnosis me and my two little boys walked up to Mommy's casket and for two years my heart didn't beat it wasn't for my faith in God I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for those two little boys there would have been no reason for which to go on I was completely lost that was rock bottom you know what sustained me the wisdom of a third grade dropout the wisdom of a simple cook we're at the casket I'd never seen my dad cry but this time I saw my dad cry that was his daughter Trina was his daughter not his daughter-in-law and I'm right behind my father about to see her for the last time on this Earth and my father shared three words with me that changed my life right there at the casket it would be the last lesson he would ever teach me he said Son just stand you keep standing you keep no matter how rough the sea you keep standing and I'm not talking about just water you keep standing no matter what you don't give up and as clearly as I'm talking to you today these were some of her last words to me she looked me in the eye and she said it doesn't matter to me any longer how long I live what matters to me most is How I Live pass y'all one question a question that I was asked All My Life by a third grade dropout how you're living how you're living every day ask yourself that question how you living here's here's what a cook would suggest you to live this way that you would not judge that you would show up early that you'd be kind that you make sure that that servant's town is huge and used that if you're going to do something you do it the right way that that cook would tell you this that it's never wrong to do the right thing that how you do anything is how you do everything and in that way you will grow your influence to make an impact and that way you will honor all those who have gone before you who have invested in you look in those unlikeliest places for wisdom enhance your life every day by seeking that wisdom and asking yourself every night how am I living may God richly bless you all thank you thank you [Music],False,the wisest person I ever met in

average I can be always been criticized about being average but I want to tell you something I stand here before you before all of these people not listening to those words but telling myself every single day to shoot for the stars to be the best that I can be good enough isnt good enough if it can be better and better isnt good enough if it can be best let me close with a very personal story that I think will bring all this into Focus wisdom will come to you in the unlikeliest of sources a lot of times through failure when you hit rock bottom remember this while youre struggling Rock Bottom can also be a great foundation on which to build and on which to grow Im not worried that youll be successful Im worried that you wont fail from time to time the person that gets up off the canvas and keeps growing thats the person that will continue to grow their influence back in the 70s they helped me make this point let me introduce you to someone Im at the finest woman I never met in my life back in my day wed have called her a brick house this woman was the finest woman Id ever seen in my life theres just one little problem back then ladies didnt like big old linemen The Blind Side hadnt come out yet they like quarterbacks and running backs were at this dance and I find out her name is Trina Williams from Lompoc California and we were all dancing and were just just excited and I decide in the middle of dancing with her that I would ask her for her phone number Chic Katrina was the first one Trina was the only woman in college who gave me her real telephone number the next day we walked to Baskin and Robins ice cream parlor my friends couldnt believe it this has been 40 years ago and my friend still cant believe it we go on a second date and a third day and a fourth day we drive from Chico to Vallejo so that she could meet my parents my father meets her my daddy my hero he meets her pulls me to the side and says is she psycho but anyway we go together for a year two years three years four years by now Trina is a senior in college Im still a freshman but Im working some things out foreign Im so glad I graduated in four terms Nixon Ford Carter Reagan so now its its time to propose so I talked to her girlfriends and its California its in the 70s so it has to be outside have to have a candle and you have to have you know some chocolate listen Im from the hood I had a bottle of Boons Farm wine thats what I had she said yes that was the key I married the most beautiful woman Id ever seen in my yall ever been to a wedding and even before the wedding starts you hear this how in the world and it was coming from my side of the family we get married we have a few children our lives are great one day Trina finds a lump in her left breasts breast cancer six years after that diagnosis me and my two little boys walked up to Mommys casket and for two years my heart didnt beat it wasnt for my faith in God I wouldnt be standing here today if it wasnt for those two little boys there would have been no reason for which to go on I was completely lost that was rock bottom you know what sustained me the wisdom of a third grade dropout the wisdom of a simple cook were at the casket Id never seen my dad cry but this time I saw my dad cry that was his daughter Trina was his daughter not his daughterinlaw and Im right behind my father about to see her for the last time on this Earth and my father shared three words with me that changed my life right there at the casket it would be the last lesson he would ever teach me he said Son just stand you keep standing you keep no matter how rough the sea you keep standing and Im not talking about just water you keep standing no matter what you dont give up and as clearly as Im talking to you today these were some of her last words to me she looked me in the eye and she said it doesnt matter to me any longer how long I live what matters to me most is How I Live pass yall one question a question that I was asked All My Life by a third grade dropout how youre living how youre living every day ask yourself that question how you living heres heres what a cook would suggest you to live this way that you would not judge that you would show up early that youd be kind that you make sure that that servants town is huge and used that if youre going to do something you do it the right way that that cook would tell you this that its never wrong to do the right thing that how you do anything is how you do everything and in that way you will grow your influence to make an impact and that way you will honor all those who have gone before you who have invested in you look in those unlikeliest places for wisdom enhance your life every day by seeking that wisdom and asking yourself every night how am I living may God richly bless you all thank you thank you

5,hallelujah choir audio,"Choir! Choir! Choir! began as a weekly drop-in singing event, equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building. In 2015, 1500 singers came to Luminato Festival in Toronto for a very special event. Choir! leaders taught them backup parts to Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, and Rufus Wainwright joined the crowd on stage to lead the vocals. The collective performance amplifies the power of the musical piece.",https://youtu.be/gCrUi_tRN8g,gCrUi_tRN8g,"[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Outro]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do ya?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

6,jason silva audio,"Storyteller Jason Silva considers the impermanence of all and the dual nature of human consciousness, through a meditation on a passage from Ernest Becker:  ""Man is literally split in two: he has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumbly to rot and disappear forever"" -Ernest Becker",https://youtu.be/Lz-P3WdIHvw,Lz-P3WdIHvw,foreign [Music] essay written by Sigmund Freud called on transients and in it he cites a conversation that he had

the exception a vision of something more a vision of a hidden door a Rabbit Hole to fall through but a temporary one and I think ultimately that is kind of the tragedy that is why I love simultaneously fills us with melancholies that's why sometimes I feel nostalgic over something I haven't lost yet because I see it's transients and so how does one respond to this do we do we love harder do we squeeze tighter or do we embrace the Buddhist Creed of no attachment so we pretend not to care than everything and everyone we know is going to be taken away from us and I I don't know if I can accept that I think I'm more sided with the Dylan Thomas quote that says I will not go quietly into that good night but instead rage against the dying of the light I think that we defy entropy

8,pale blue dot audio,"On Feb. 14, 1990, astronomer Carl Sagan gave a never-seen-before perspective of our home planet. Voyager 1 spacecraft was departing our solar system, and Sagan convinced NASA to turn the camera for one last look toward Earth. Pale Blue Dot is the resulting photograph of our planet, from a record distance of 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles). The Earth appears as a tiny dot against the vastness of space, and Sagan beautifully reflects on our place in the immense scope of the cosmos.",https://youtu.be/T2Qv_Vms-Yw,T2Qv_Vms-Yw,"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.

From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, its different. Consider again at that dot. Thats here. Thats home. Thats us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived thereon a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
 The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
 Our posturings, our imagined selfimportance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
 The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

15,great dictator audio,"In the 1940 satire-drama The Great Dictator, Charlie Chaplin plays 2 doppelganger characters: a fascist dictator and a Jewish barber avoiding persecution. In this scene, the Barber is mistaken for the Dictator and must give a speech. Revered as one of the greatest monologues in film history, Chaplin makes a call for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite people in the name of democracy. What you are about to hear is the voice of Charlie Chaplin from the middle of World War II. For his entire career, he had been a silent actor. But in 1940, he decided to speak out. This is his message of hope.

although I may not be quite as refined as aesthetically as he is that I can appreciate the beauty of the flower at the same time I see much more about the flower that he sees I could imagine the cells in there the complicated actions inside which also have a beauty I mean it's not just Beauty at this dimension of one centimeter there's also Beauty in the smaller Dimensions the inner structure also

out more about it you see one thing is I can live without doubt and uncertainty and not knowing I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things but I'm not absolutely sure of anything and the many things I don't know anything about but I don't

23,mr rogers testimony,"In 1969, facing government budget cuts to public broadcasting, Fred Rogers successfully went before congress to advocate for funding children’s educational programming. Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, had recently become nationally syndicated. Rogers described how he speaks to children on his show and how he felt that showing people working out their emotions was both more dramatic and more constructive than violence.",https://youtu.be/iiFEiUe8k8U,iiFEiUe8k8U,now Mr Rogers is certainly one of the best things that's ever happened to public television and his Peabody Award is Testament to that fact we in public television are proud of Fred Rogers and I'm proud to present Mr Rogers to you now all right Rogers you got the floor senator pastori this is a philosophical statement and would take about 10 minutes to read so I'll not do that uh one of the first things that a child learns in a healthy family is Trust and I trust what you have said that you will read this it's very important to me I care deeply about children my first job will it make you happy if you read it I'd just like to talk about it my first Children's Program was on WQED 15 years ago and its budget was thirty dollars now with the help of the Sears Roebuck foundation and National educational television as well as all of the Affiliated stations each station pays to show our program it's a unique kind of funding in educational television with this help now our program has a budget of six thousand dollars it may sound like quite a difference but six thousand dollars pays for less than two minutes of cartoons two minutes of animated what I sometimes say bombardment I'm very much concerned as I know you are about what's being delivered to our children in this country and I've worked in the field of child development for six years now trying to understand the inner needs of children we deal with such things as as the inner drama of childhood we don't have to bop somebody over the head to make him to make drama on the screen we deal with such things as getting a haircut or the feelings about brothers and sisters and the kind of anger that arises in simple family situations and we speak to it constructively how long a program is it it's a half hour every day most channels schedule it in the noon time as well as in the evening of WETA here has scheduled it in the late afternoon could we get a copy of this so that we can see it and maybe not today but I'd like to see the program I'd like very much for you I'd like to see the program itself or any one of them you see we we made a hundred programs for een the Eastern educational Network and then when the money ran out people in Boston and Pittsburgh and Chicago all came to the fore and said we've got to have more of this neighborhood expression of care and this is what this is what I give I give an expression of care every day to each child to help him realize that he is unique I end the program by saying you've made this day a special day by just your being you there's no person in the whole world like you and I like you just the way you are and I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable we will have done a great service for mental health I think that it's much more dramatic that two men could be working out their feelings of anger much more dramatic than showing something of gunfire I'm constantly concerned about what our children are seeing and for 15 years I have tried in this country and Canada to present what I feel is a meaningful expression of care do you narrate it I'm the host yes and I do all the puppets and I write all the music and I write all the scripts I'm supposed to be a pretty tough guy and this the first time I've had goosebumps for the last two days well I'm grateful not only for your Goosebumps but for your interest in in our kind of communication could I tell you the words of one of the songs which I feel is very important yes this has to do with that good feeling of control which I feel that the children need to know is there and it starts out what do you do with the mad that you feel and that first line came straight from a child I work with children doing puppets in in very personal communication with small groups what do you do with the mad that you feel when you feel so mad you could bite when the whole wide world seems oh so wrong and nothing you do seems very right what do you do do you punch a bag do you pound some clay or some dough do you round up friends for a game of tag or see how fast you go it's great to be able to stop when you've planned a thing that's wrong and be able to do something else instead and think this song I can stop when I want to can stop when I wish can stop stop stop anytime and what a good feeling to feel like this and know that the feeling is really mine know that there's something deep inside that helps us become what we can for a girl can be someday a lady and a boy can be someday a man I think it's wonderful I think it's wonderful looks like you just earned the 20 million dollars [Applause],False,now Mr Rogers is certainly one of the best things thats ever happened to public television and his Peabody Award is Testament to that fact we in public television are proud of Fred Rogers and Im proud to present Mr Rogers to you now all right Rogers you got the floor senator pastori this is a philosophical statement and would take about 10 minutes to read so Ill not do that uh one of the first things that a child learns in a healthy family is Trust and I trust what you have said that you will read this its very important to me I care deeply about children my first job will it make you happy if you read it Id just like to talk about it my first Childrens Program was on WQED 15 years ago and its budget was thirty dollars now with the help of the Sears Roebuck foundation and National educational television as well as all of the Affiliated stations each station pays to show our program its a unique kind of funding in educational television with this help now our program has a budget of six thousand dollars it may sound like quite a difference but six thousand dollars pays for less than two minutes of cartoons two minutes of animated what I sometimes say bombardment Im very much concerned as I know you are about whats being delivered to our children in this country and Ive worked in the field of child development for six years now trying to understand the inner needs of children we deal with such things as as the inner drama of childhood we dont have to bop somebody over the head to make him to make drama on the screen we deal with such things as getting a haircut or the feelings about brothers and sisters and the kind of anger that arises in simple family situations and we speak to it constructively how long a program is it its a half hour every day most channels schedule it in the noon time as well as in the evening of WETA here has scheduled it in the late afternoon could we get a copy of this so that we can see it and maybe not today but Id like to see the program Id like very much for you Id like to

38,great dictator,"In the 1940 satire-drama The Great Dictator, Charlie Chaplin plays 2 doppelganger characters: a fascist dictator and a Jewish barber avoiding persecution. In this scene, the Barber is mistaken for the Dictator and must give a speech. Revered as one of the greatest monologues in film history, Chaplin makes a call for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite people in the name of democracy. What you are about to hear is the voice of Charlie Chaplin from the middle of World War II. For his entire career, he had been a silent actor. But in 1940, he decided to speak out. This is his message of hope. ",https://youtu.be/VMgdGswaI5s,VMgdGswaI5s,"Im sorry, but I dont want to be an emperor. Thats not my business. I dont want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others happiness - not by each others misery. We dont want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned mens souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish

Soldiers! dont give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Dont give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You dont hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Dont fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: the Kingdom of God is within man - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all mens happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!",False,"Im sorry, but I dont want to be an emperor. Thats not my business. I dont want to rule or conquer anyone.
