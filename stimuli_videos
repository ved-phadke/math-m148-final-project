17,The Great Dictator,"In the 1940 satire-drama The Great Dictator, Charlie Chaplin plays 2 doppelganger characters: a fascist dictator and a Jewish barber avoiding persecution. In this scene, the Barber is mistaken for the Dictator and must give a speech. Revered as one of the greatest monologues in film history, Chaplin makes a call for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite people in the name of democracy. What you are about to hear is the voice of Charlie Chaplin from the middle of World War II. For his entire career, he had been a silent actor. But in 1940, he decided to speak out. This is his message of hope.
